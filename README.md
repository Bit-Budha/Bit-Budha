A preview of my programming proficiency

Around 2021 I wanted to be a fornt End Web Devloper and studied a bit of HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT

Then I wanted to be a Blockchain Engineer and looked into the Solidity programming language for the Ethereum Blockchain.

Ever since November 2024 I've gotten into more bootcamps, apprentichsips and mentorships and have been getting deeper into Cybersecurity with a inerest in the Ethical Hacking.

I've been using Linux for years and am getting deeper into Bash. 

Next to that I have also looked into CMD and Powershell, I like anything that keeps me in the CLI (Command Line Interface)

The lanaguage I respect the most is x86_64 Assembly Language, it really teaches how the CPU works on a intricate level. 

I also have a interest in C and Rust.
