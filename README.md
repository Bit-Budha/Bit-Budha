# Preview Of My Programming Proficiency

I looked Blockchain Engineering and studied the `Solidity` programming language for the Ethereum Blockchain.<br>

I explored Front End Web Devlopment and studied a bit of `HTML`, `CSS` and `Javascript`. I'm going to be building out my website. Here are a few of my <a href="https://github.com/Bit-Budha/website_inspirations.repo/tree/main">inspirations</a>.

I'm getting into Live Coding music with this platform that uses Javascript.

**I love Linux and have beeen using it for years for years and am getting deeper into `Bash`.`vim` is my favorite text editor. I've used Ubutnu, Kubuntu, Kali Linux and am moving onto REHL (Red Hat Enterpise Linux) for my personal computing as I study for my RHCSA (Red Hat Certified System Administrator) to be become a Linux System Administrator<br>

I love anything that keeps me in the CLI (Command Line Interface), so on the Windows side I looked into`CMD` batch scripts and `Powershell`, <br>

I dabbled in `C#` a bit for my interest in Unity game engine..<br>

I also have to learn more of `C` to understand the Linux Keranl better, also I know `Rust` is gradually being addeded into the Linux Kernal as well so I have to be ready for that as well. <br>

The lanaguage I respect the most is `x86_64 Assembly Language`, it really teaches how the CPU works on a intricate level. I respect Malware Analyst and Reverse Engineers a ton.<br>
